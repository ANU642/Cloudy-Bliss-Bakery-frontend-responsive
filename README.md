# Cloudy-Bliss-Bakery-frontend-responsive
Cloudy Bliss Bakery
I'm super excited to post my project on responsive,interactive frontend for a bakery website built with mock data. Users can browse cakes and cupcakes, add to cart, and simulate checkout.
Setup Steps:
1) Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2) Open the index.html file in any modern web browser.
3) No server or installation required â€“ it's a static site.
Tech Stack Used
HTML: For structure and layout.
CSS: For styling, animations, and responsiveness.
JavaScript: For interactivity e.g., cart, popups, filtering.
Bonus Features Implemented
Assumptions: All data is mock hardcoded in JS; no real backend or payment processing. Images are from Unsplash or external sources for demo purposes.
Bonus Features: 3D pop-up animations, scrolling discount banner, empty cart message, responsive design for mobile, and hover effects for better UX.
