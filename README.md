# Cloudy-Bliss-Bakery-frontend-responsive

I'm super excited to share my project: a responsive, interactive frontend for a bakery website built with mock data. Users can browse cakes and cupcakes, add to cart, and simulate checkout

Setup Steps:
1) Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2) Open the index.html file in any modern web browser.
3) No server or installation required – it's a static site.

Tech Stack Used

1) HTML: For structure and layout.
2) CSS: For styling, animations, and responsiveness.
3) JavaScript: For interactivity e.g., cart, popups, filtering.
   
Screenshots or Short Screen Recording

Screenshot 1: Homepage – Shows the product grid and filters.
Screenshot 2: Popup – Displays the 3D popup for a product.
Short Screen Recording – A 30-second video demo of browsing, adding to cart, and checkout.
   
Bonus Features Implemented

i) Assumptions: All data is mock hardcoded in JS; no real backend or payment processing. Images are from Unsplash or external sources for demo purposes.
ii) Bonus Features: 3D pop-up animations, scrolling discount banner, empty cart message, responsive design for mobile, and hover effects for better UX.
